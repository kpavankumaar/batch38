		Madhuravani(Samantha) is a journalist in Madras who is assigned the duty of covering Savitri’s case after the actress ends up in a coma. Madhuravani decides to go neck deep into Savitri’s life and starts penning her life story from all the sources she meets. Rest of the story is showcased in a flashback mode from where Savitri played by Keerty Suresh becomes this great actress and how her life ends up in all kinds of problems after she falls in love with Gemini Ganesan(Dulquer Salman).

		Firstly, credit should go to director Nag Ashwin for thinking of making a biopic on the life of an actress who was very famous in Telugu film history. What makes this film interesting is that Nag Ashwin does not shy away from showcasing Savitri’s dark secrets and narrates exactly as to what happened in the life of one of the greatest actresses Telugu cinema has ever seen.

		Keerthy Suresh gets the role of a lifetime and boy she delivers the knock out punch. She will never get such a tailor-made role in her career and she leads from the front in terms of performance. The innocence of Savitri, her rise to stardom and her addiction to alcohol, Keerthy has portrayed all the emotions with aplomb. Keerthy is especially superb in the second half and delivers her best in all the climax scenes of the film.
